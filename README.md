![TryHackMe Badge](<img src="https://tryhackme-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/pkar.png" alt="Your Image Badge" />)

---

## üìÑ Introduction  
This **Cybersecurity Portfolio** demonstrates my **practical learning journey** using **TryHackMe labs** as part of the *ITECH1502 Cybersecurity Fundamentals* course at **Federation University**.  

The aim was to bridge **theoretical knowledge** with **real-world applications** in:  
- **Incident Response**  
- **Digital Forensics**  
- **Reconnaissance Techniques**  
- **Vulnerability Scanning**  

The project aligns with **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0** and includes **evidence, project reports, and reflections** for assessment and career development purposes.  

---

## üéØ Learning Objectives  
- Apply **NIST CSF 2.0** concepts to simulated cybersecurity scenarios.  
- Gain **hands-on experience** in vulnerability scanning, incident response, and forensics.  
- Develop **technical skills** using tools like **Nmap, Whois, Nslookup, Traceroute**, and **Windows Forensic analyzers**.  
- Build a **career-ready portfolio** hosted on GitHub for future employers.  
- Reflect on **professional growth** and identify areas for **continuous improvement**.
